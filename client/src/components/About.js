					This is an application that is designed to mimic the very basic
					functionality of twitter but sweeter. A user can create an account or
					login to their existing account, create a sweet (tweet) and read
					through current sweets that have been made by other users. The only
					caveat is that profanity is not allowed and positivity is extremely
					encouraged! When a user creates a new sweet, only then will that user
					have permission to edit or delete that post. An admin can have
					permission to edit or delete any post.
					<br />
					Thanks for visiting!
					{/* A user can also add any post to their favorite list and subsequently remove that item on the Favorites page. */}
